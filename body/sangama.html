            Personally telling, Bhaari Pada tha Yeh Trip .But this trip was the Best Trip we all had till now, A perfect Road Trip with Bikes like Hornet, X-Blade & a Yellow Vespa Hired From Drivezy. The Trip Started in the Morning at around 7am with Bikes Exceeding The Speed Limit of 100kmph over NICE Road. We Had Our Breakfast Idli Sambhar at a small Kove Idli mane which was worth the cost. After having breakfast we continued with the trip. As we went on we came across our new Kanakpura campus which is under construction. Took some great pics, had a rubbish talk on the college and went on. Later at some point there was a sudden hit of Vespa to a Ricksaw as the brake was loose. After that incident we went on slowly and near a place we took some great pics clicked by Rishav and halted. Later we started our ride and moved on safely. It took us 2 hours to reach the point. Finally we reached Mekedatu Lake and took pictures in the water there and had to hurry as there was some assignment was to be submitted to one of our friend Ashish. We left early and had to ride fast in order to reach our college early. We reached in about an hour to our college, got the work done and had our lunch in Udupi Upahar. It was 4:30pm by the time we had our lunch. We then made our way to hostel and went to give the rental bikes. We had to pay a huge money of 4500 because of the crack to the vehicle. But Yeah it was aGood experience.The Trip ended Happily but yeah We were Sad about our 4500 rupees.
