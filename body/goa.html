            It is a dream for all the batchmates to make a trip to GOA. We did it successfully. After a hectic end exams, we planned to go. 
On 4th January we started our journey to Goa. We left our hostel at 7pm. We reached Yeshwantpur Railway Station by an hour. Took our things and waited there.
Unfortunately due to delay in train we had to wait for sometime. But after sometime the train arrived and our journey started. Next day ie on 5th we reached Goa after a delay of 3 hours. Totally tired of the journey we got down at Madgaon Railway station at 2:30pm. Our plan of spending some time at the market was flopped.
We got a vehicle at the railway station which left us to our guesthouse 1000 Stays. We went there and without wasting time headed to eat something. At around 3pm we had our lunch. Everyone seemed hungry after the long journey. We had our lunch and went to Benaulim beach. We played in the beach, took pics and around 6:30pm left from there. While coming took a beer(Hieneken) and made our way to guesthouse. After taking some rest,we went out to have our dinner. At 10pm we came back to our guesthouse. After coming, drank the beer and enjoyed the moment. After having that we went to sleep.
Next day ie.6th, the plan was to roam the city. But because of Ayush,since he went to the beachside, we were a bit late. Somehow, we started roaming around goa in the Innova at 9am. We first went to Old Goa Church. As soon as we reached there, we had our breakfast. Some ate omelette and some roti. After a full filled breakfast, we went to the church. There we saw many old monuments, visited the Church of Se Cathedral.Coming out from there, we had ice cream which a need that time. After that we left to the state capital Panaji.
While we were going, we saw the famous poker game(from the car) situated in the midsea, which was fascinating. We then went to Miramar beach where Singham movie scene was shot. We were a while there and then went to buy Cashew to a nearby shop. Took everything and then we headed towards our lunch.
Tried fish and others veg. Then we went to Chapora fort. There we had a lot of fun and it was almost sunset when we left from there. We then headed to Madgaon Railway station as one of our friend Yuvraj was heading back to Bangalore. We bid a final goodbye to him and made our way to Belgaum, where we were supposed to stay in our friend ,Shrinivas house for a day. By the time we reached Belgaum it was 10pm. We had our dinner and then slept off. Next day we had our breakfast in Shrinivas house and then took some rest. At 12pm our friend Tanveer has his train to Bellary. He went back. We then roamed in Belgaum till noon, had lunch and then rested. That evening it was time to bid a goodbye as everyone were going back to their hometown. 
Overall, it was a worth remembering trip for all of us as it was the first time for some of our friends. Everyone seemed enthusiastic and the trip went on to be a great one. Will cherish the memories for lifetime..
