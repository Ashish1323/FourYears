            This was indeed a hilarious trip. We had booked the vehicles namely Dominor 400, Royal enfield Classic as well as thunderbird, Yamaha Fz and activa. By midnight, we received a message from Drivezy that we cannot get the vehicles due to some reasons. It was devastating seeing the message the day we were about to leave. We somehow could book other vehicles like Fascino and Activa. In this bad mood that we couldnâ€™t get bikes we went on the trip. We started our trip at 7am. 
        
             We had hired a DSLR for this trip which was handled by Rishav Aryan. We went on clicking the pics as we passed by. After sometime we had our breakfast at Udupi Upahar which was worth the day. We continued with the trip and reached Savandurga Hill after 3 hours( as we clicked many pics, we were late). Without wasting time we climbed the top hill in 1 and half hour. There, the view was astonishing. We spent some time there and clicked many pics there. In sometime we came down. It took us less than an hour to come down. We had coconut water and quenched our thirst. We left back to our hostel in sometime. We rode fast yet safe in order to reach early as there was a time constraint. We reached early and gave our vehicles in time. We then went to give the DSLR and reached hostel in sometime. It was indeed a great trip but still the dream of going on bikes was a memory. Next trip is always a Bike trip.
