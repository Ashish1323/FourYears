            We started our journey on 16th April from Bangalore's KSR station at 6:25pm. Was a great experience in the train with friends. We had nice time with each other and time                    passed by well. 
            On the next day ie 17th April, we reached Hyderabad's Kacheguda Railway station at 6:35am and then made our way to the hotel named Hotel Haridwar.. We reached there within 15 min made all the formalities and went to our room to get freshened..We had bath, took rest and left for some side seeing at around 8:45am.
We first went to Nehru zoological park and had fun time there. We saw many aquatic animals, lion,giraffe, rhino and many other animals present there..After a long walk we had pav bhaji in the park canteen which was delicious. After that we took rest and left from there.
We next went to Sudha car museum wherein we saw many old cars kept there..there we around 150 vehicle types including cycles..we clicked many pics of ours with the car. After a long chat with friends of where to go, finally we left back to our hotel.. it was about 2:30pm we reached our hotel.
We rested in our hotel for about an hour and at around 5:30pm we left to one of the greatest place namely Charminar. We took many photos and enjoyed very much. We then went to Mecca Masjid which is biggest in Hyderabad.. After that we had delicious biryani which was worth eating. After having dinner we went back to our hotel...It was 9:00pm by the time we reached our hotel. We we're off to sleep after we reached our hotel.
Next day i.e on 18th April, we made a Hyderabad bus tour which toured us around the whole Hyderabad.
Our journey started from Birla mandir where we got blessings of God.The view from there was just awesome. Later we went to Nizam Museum where we got to see the longest Almirah(175ft) and many things of theirs'. We even got to know about their wealth and their way of life. Then we visited Charminar again, but didn't go out this time.. After sometime we went to Chowmahalla palace, where we saw the throne of king made of gold and some silver made things. We took many pics of it and left from there. Then we went to Salal jung museum where we saw Salal jung king place..We spent some time there and left for lunch..It was 1:45pm by the time we reached the hotel named Kamat.After having lunch we had a good sleep in the bus.By the time we woke up we were at Sudha car museum. Since we had been there yesterday we didn't go inside but had a good conversation within ourselves. We then went to 3D world where we got to know more about Hyderabad and it's history. After a long 40 min session, we then went to Golconda Fort which was worth watching and spending time..It was about 6:00pm when we left from there.
After that at around 7:00pm we reached lumbini park but couldn't go inside due to time problem. We just visited from outside and left to Kacheguda Railway station. We reached within half an hour and had dinner nearby. Our train to Bangalore was at 9:00pm. We sat in the train and left.. It was a memorable journey with friends..
Next day in the morning something great happened. Kinners came to our boggie and asked for money. 2 of my friends gave but one friend happened not to give . They caught him and asked to marry and many other naughty talk happened. Was a great memory at the end. We reached Yeshwantpur railway station at 11:10am and made our way to our hostel..
It was one of the greatest memory with friends.. These 2 days were the best day of our lives and most probably a memorable one too..
